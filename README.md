# Final-Project

The final project assignment is designed to show statistical data from openpowerlifting.org and compare 5 individual lifters (myself included) based on the 3 main lifts: Squat, Bench, and Deadlift.

Using the openipf.csv file, I was bale to import the data and create charts/graphs to visualize and modify the information given.
