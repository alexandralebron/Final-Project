# Final-Project

The final project assignment is designed to show statistical data from openpowerlifting.org and compare 5 individual lifters (myself included) based on the 3 main lifts: Squat, Bench, and Deadlift.

Using the openipf.csv file, I was bale to import the data and create charts/graphs to visualize and modify the information given.

## Instructions on How to Compile Code.py
- Ensure we have a Python IDE (for this project, I compiled the code on JupyterLab).
- Ensure the openipf.csv file is saved to local drive.
- Click Run.
- You will see the various charts and graphs visualizing the data given.
